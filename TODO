For 1.0
----------

+ hs-plugins doesn't know to look for packages in the user packages,
only in the global packages

+ version numbers in package loads are annyoing

+ .hi file parser is broken on Itanium, again.

+ build way=p and way=''

Cabal
--------

What we'd like is a cabalMake version of make, so rather than just
compiling simple plugins, we let cabalMake rebuild whole Haskell apps --
like Yi!
