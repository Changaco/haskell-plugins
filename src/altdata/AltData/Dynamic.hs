-- reimplement the Data.Dynamic library to use equality over the
-- canonical name of a type, rather than on integer keys. The later is
-- how the Haskell library works, and is broken for our situation:
-- static versus dynamic instances of the same type seem to generate
-- different keys, meaning equal types are not detected as such.
