-- note: the name of the original *source* module is used to find
-- symbols in the *object* file. load works out what the source file
-- name was by looking at the object file name, i.e. it assumes they
-- have the same name. so, if you are going to store objects in a
-- tmpdir, you should make a tmp directory, and store them inside that,
-- rather than mkstemp'ing the name of the object file yourself.
--
-- this should go away once we can read .hi files.
