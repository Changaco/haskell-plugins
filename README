                            hs-plugins
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiler and tool support for compiling and loading, and evaluating
Haskell at runtime.

The library provides a convenient interface to GHC's runtime loader
and linker, letting you load compiled Haskell code.

It also provides a `make' system for compiling plugin source
automagically and for combining the user's .hs file with a stub of
standard declarations and syntax, saving the user from having to write
standard code themselves.

It provides an eval() function, for generating new, well-typed,
compiled code from a Haskell source string.

It also provides a new variation of printf for Haskell-- a runtime
generated, dynamically-typed printf.

Read the documentation in doc/ for more.

DEPENDENCIES:

* Requires HSX, Niklas Broberg's Haskell parser library, available at:
    http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~d00nibro/haskell-src-exts
  Read the README with this package for how to install it (quite simple)

* Requires GNU make or BSD make to build
* Requires GHC > 6.2 (for Typeable.h)
* 'plugs' requires a working readline library.

* If you wish to use TH in plugins, or to run load()-programs in GHCi,
  you require a patch to GHC's linker, that was committed into ghc
  6.3, and ghc 6.2 -stable branch, and is available from 6.2.2 onwards.

* If you need to regenerate ./configure you need >= autoconf-2.53

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING:
        $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make
        $ make install

If you wish to register the libraries as official ghc pkg (probably as
root):
	$ make register

And to unregister (maybe as root). Note that the unistall order
matters:

        $ ghc-pkg -r printf
        $ ghc-pkg -r eval
        $ ghc-pkg -r plugins
        $ ghc-pkg -r hi
        $ ghc-pkg -r altdata

Once it is registered, you can link against the library by just adding
-package plugins or, e.g. -package eval, to your command line.

The documentation relies on latex, dvips, tex2page:

        $ cd doc && make

EXAMPLES:

Have a look in the examples/ directory for many examples of how to
arrange your code.

LICENSE:

This library is distributed under the terms of the LGPL. The runtime
loader code is based on code written by André Pang, and others, and is
distributed under the BSD-style Glasgow University license.

PORTABILITY:

Requires GHC 6.2 or greater, though most testing has be done on 6.3.
They dynamic loader requires a functional GHCi implementation.
